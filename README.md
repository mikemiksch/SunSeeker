# SunSeeker

A two-day challenge to build an app to the following specifications:

```App concept:
-An app for helping Seattleites escape rainy weather 

Project structure:

-An iOS app written in either Objective-C or Swift
-Using auto-layout to dynamically display the content for any iOS device
-Deliverable as a zipped folder containing the XCode project/workspace

App Functionality:

-Ask user for necessary permissions
-Determine which cities within 750 miles of Seattle have sunny weather/forecasts
-Rank cities by favorability of forecast
-Allow user to “book” a flight to the city of their choice (This part should be faked)
-Present user with a review of their itinerary
-Use your own judgement to fill in the gaps of the UX
